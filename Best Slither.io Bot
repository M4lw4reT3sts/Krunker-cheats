This bot plays very defensive and SHOULDN'T die within atleast 30 minutes of gameplay
The bot also likes to fuck up other players with it's annoying playstyle and abuses the slither.io hitboxes to stay alive and detects other people their movement along with their plans.
The bot also has a built-in anti-circle system so it boosts away whenever it detects that a bigger snake is attempting to circle you

The default options are the best but i prefer to set the range multiplier to 13 (because 15 is too much and the default of 10 is just too little)

another useful bot that gets score really nicely is
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/19278-slither-io-bot
this one goes for score and it's made all the way in 2016 and still works perfectly today
It gets score faster then SlitherWorldHax
however this one dies too much and SlitherWorld OVERHAX.ML never died for me
